Snippet files: Numbered in the order they appeared. Extensions are auto-detected:

.cr → Crystal source code

.yml → shard configuration / YAML

.sh → shell commands

.json / .xml → data/config examples

.txt → other text-like snippets

INDEX.csv: Lists every snippet with chapter, filename, type, and line count.

📝 Notes

Formatting is preserved as closely as possible from the book.

File types are guessed based on content (best effort).

Some non-code diagrams or trees may have been excluded to avoid clutter.

Snippets are kept separate so you can study or run them individually.

🚀 How to Use

Open the INDEX.csv to quickly locate a snippet by chapter and order.

Navigate to the corresponding chapter folder and open the .cr or other file.

Run Crystal snippets using:

crystal run snippet_001.cr


(Adjust filename as needed.)

Use the shell/YAML/JSON/XML files for setup and configuration practice.
